Vector Stores
=============

In the realm of handling unstructured data, a prevalent method involves embedding the data and storing the resultant vectors. When querying, the
unstructured query undergoes a similar embedding process, allowing retrieval of vectors most akin to the embedded query. This process is streamlined
by a vector store, which handles the storage of embedded data and facilitates seamless vector searches on your behalf.

EvaDB supports the following Vector Stores.
